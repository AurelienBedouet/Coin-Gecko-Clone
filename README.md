# Coin Gecko Clone.
React Js / Tailwind CSS / Firebase

I used the firebase hosting service
### Live demo : https://coin-gecko-clone.web.app/

### In this app i used:
- The useContext hook for the dark/light themes and the user authentication
- React Router to handle the navigation
- axios to fecth the data from the coin gecko API
- Firebase for the user authentication and to store the user's data (in this case the coins stored in the watchlist)
- the react-icons library for the icons
- react-sparklines for the sparklines
- react-paginate for the pagination
- DOMPurify to "sanitize" the HTML received through the coin gecko API on the Coin Pages (description)
